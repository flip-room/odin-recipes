    <ol>
        <li>
            Warm a large pan over medium-high 
            heat. Add beef and cook, stirring 
            and breaking it up, until beginning 
            to brown, about 5 minutes. Drain 
            off all but 1 Tbsp. of fat, if 
            necessary. Add mushrooms, onion 
            and garlic; saut√© for 5 minutes. 
            Stir in tomato puree, broth, 
            Italian seasoning, bay leaf and 
            1/2 tsp. each salt and pepper. 
            Bring to a boil, then reduce heat 
            to lowest setting and simmer for 
            45 minutes, stirring often.
        </li>
    
        <li>
            Bring a large pot of salted water 
            to a boil and cook spaghetti until 
            al dente, about 10 minutes or as 
            package label directs. Remove bay 
            leaf from sauce and season with 
            additional salt and pepper, if 
            desired. Pour sauce over 
            spaghetti, toss and serve.
