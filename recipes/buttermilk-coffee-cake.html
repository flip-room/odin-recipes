    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>This buttermilk crumb cake is a 
        breakfast favorite when guests arrive. 
        To make one day ahead: just bake, cool 
        completely, and cover pan tightly in 
        aluminum foil. For an even more 
        decadent treat, make this delicious

        cake: Combine 1/2 cup powdered sugar, 
        3 teaspoons milk, and 1/2 teaspoon 
        vanilla in a small bowl; and stir 
        until smooth.

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Preheat oven to 325°F.
        </li>
    
        <li>
            Stir together Streusel Topping 
            ingredients (brown sugar, 1/3 cup 
            granulated sugar, cinnamon, and 
            chopped nuts) in a small bowl until 
            combined. Set aside.
        </li>
    
        <li>
            Cream butter and sugar at medium 
            speed with an electric mixer until 
            light and fluffy. Add eggs, 1 at a 
            time, beating just until yellow

            alternately with buttermilk, 
            beginning and ending with flour 
            mixture. Beat at low speed just 
            until blended after each addition. 
            Stir in vanilla. Pour batter into a 
            greased 9- x 13-inch pan; sprinkle
