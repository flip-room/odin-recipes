    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Place potatoes in a Dutch oven; 
            cover with cold water to 2 inches 
            above potatoes. Bring to a boil; 
            reduce heat, and simmer 15 minutes 
            or until very tender. Drain; place 
            in a large bowl.
        </li>
    
        <li>
            Heat oil and butter in a medium 
            skillet over medium heat until 
            butter melts. Split vanilla bean 
            lengthwise; scrape out seeds. Add 
            seeds and vanilla bean pod to oil 
            mixture; cook 30 seconds. Remove 
            pan from heat; let stand 10 minutes. Remove pod; discard.
        </li>
    
        <li>
            Preheat oven to 375°F.
        </li>
    
        <li>
            Add 2 tablespoons sugar, 1 teaspoon 
            salt, cinnamon, and milk to 
            potatoes. Beat with a mixer at 
            medium speed until smooth. Spoon 
            potato mixture into an 11 x 7-inch 
            baking dish coated with cooking 
            spray.
        </li>
        <li>
            Add oats, pecans, flour, remaining 
            1/4 cup sugar, and remaining 
            1/4 teaspoon salt to butter 
            mixture; toss. Sprinkle over 
            potato mixture. Bake at 375°F for 
            35 minutes or until bubbly around 
            the edges.
