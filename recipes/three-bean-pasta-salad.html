    <h1>Three-Bean Pasta Salad</h1><br>
    <img src="./images/three-bean-pasta-salad.jpeg" alt="Three-Bean Pasta Salad" width="100%" max-width="max-content">
    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>We combined two potluck classics—pasta 
        salad and three-bean salad—to make 
        one tasty new side dish. Blanched 
        celery is the unexpected star in this 
        side dish; it has a tender-crisp 
        texture and bright green color. Swap 
        out the canned beans for your 
        favorite cooked field peas.
    </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>8 ounces uncooked small shell pasta</li>
        <li>8 ounces fresh green beans, trimmed and cut into 1-in. pieces (about 2 cups)</li>
        <li>½ cup thinly sliced celery (about 1 stalk)</li>
        <li>1 pinto beans, drained and rinsed</li>
        <li>1 red kidney beans, drained and rinsed</li>
        <li>1 small shallot, minced</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons rice wine vinegar</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon lemon zest plus 2 Tbsp. fresh juice (from 1 lemon)</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon Dijon mustard</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon honey</li>
        <li>¾ cup olive oil</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon black pepper</li>
        <li>¼ cup thinly sliced chives</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Cook pasta according to package 
            directions for salted water. 
            Drain and rinse with cold water; 
            drain.
        </li>
    
        <li>
            Cook green beans and celery in 
            boiling salted water to cover until 
            tender-crisp, about 2 minutes. 
            Drain and plunge into ice water 
            to stop the cooking process; drain. 
            Combine pasta, green beans, celery, 
            pinto beans, and kidney beans in a 
            large bowl.
        </li>
    
        <li>
            Combine shallot and vinegar in a 
            medium bowl; let stand about 
            5 minutes. Add lemon zest, lemon 
            juice, mustard, and honey, 
            stirring with a whisk. Gradually 
            whisk in oil until well combined; 
            pour over bean mixture. Sprinkle 
            with salt and pepper; toss gently. 
            Sprinkle with chives, and serve 
            immediately.
