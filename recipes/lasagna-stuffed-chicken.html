    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>It's no mystery why this fun stuffed 
        chicken recipe was a huge hit in our 
        test kitchen: Comforting classic 
        Italian flavors shine here, while 
        the creamy mozzarella balances the 
        acidic tomato sauce nicely. Plus, 
        the pocket of cheesy pesto keeps the 
        chicken moist during the cooking 
        process. These stuffed chicken 
        breasts come together quickly and 
        easily, making them perfect for busy 
        weeknights.

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup marinara sauce (from 1 [24-oz.] jar), divided</li>
        <li>¾ cup whole-milk ricotta cheese (from 1 [16-oz.] container)</li>
        <li>¼ cup refrigerated basil pesto (from 1 [6-oz.] jar)</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon crushed red pepper (optional)</li>
        <li>1 ¼ teaspoons kosher salt, divided</li>
        <li>4 (8-oz.) boneless, skinless chicken breasts, trimmed</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon dried Italian seasoning</li>
        <li>4 ounces mozzarella cheese, shredded (about 1 cup)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Preheat oven to 375°F with rack 
            7 inches from heat source. 
            Spread 1/2 cup of the marinara 
            evenly in bottom of a broiler-safe 
            11- x 7-inch baking dish.
        </li>
    
        <li>
            Stir together ricotta, pesto, 
            crushed red pepper, and 
            1/4 teaspoon of the salt in a 
            medium bowl.
        </li>
    
        <li>
            Season chicken evenly on both 
            sides with Italian seasoning and 
            remaining 1 teaspoon salt. Slice 
            each chicken breast in half 
            horizontally, cutting to but not 
            through the other side. Working 
            with 1 chicken breast at a time, 
            open breast halves like a book, 
            and spread 1 side with 1/4 cup 
            ricotta mixture. Fold chicken 
            breast back up, and secure with 
            wooden picks. Arrange chicken 
            evenly on top of marinara in 
            baking dish. Spread chicken 
            evenly with remaining 1/2 cup 
            marinara; sprinkle with mozzarella.
        </li>
    
        <li>
            Cover baking dish with aluminum 
            foil. Bake in preheated oven until 
            a thermometer inserted into 
            thickest portion of chicken 
            registers 165°F, 30 to 35 minutes. 
            Remove baking dish from oven; 
            remove foil, and remove wooden 
            picks from chicken. Increase oven 
            temperature to broil. Return baking 
            dish to oven. Broil until 
            mozzarella is melted, golden, 
            and bubbling, 3 to 5 minutes. 
            Let rest 5 minutes. Serve.
